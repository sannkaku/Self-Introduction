						</div>
						<div class= "menu_inclution">
							<p>I have always wished to <b>use my avilities and traits for the happinesses of people since my diagnosis</b> in 21st, January, 2012.</p>
							<p>After the dignosis, I had been in charge of procurement division for 5.5 years with the recognition of my disorder in my workplace.
							According to some of my former bosses and colleagus. there are no personnel who can understand English and good at handling international trades. 
							It seems to be lingerling bother for my division. I happened to show my TOEIC score to company, so I was accepted for this company.</p>
							<p>One of my weaknesses from my syndrome is that I may get stucked within a moment when I was requested to respond quickly and flexiblly so often.
							However, this international trading is not required to be so flexible, but focus on precision to acquire merchandises to the factory`s warehouse with a big lot.
							So I feel this task is fit with me in this workplace. On the other hand, most of the domestic procurements require flexibilities. So my colleagues focused on those tasks.
							I wish I could contribute <b>for mutual helps and respects in the division</b>.
							<p>The purchasing by understanding the circumstances of each country was not suffer for me. I am also thankful that
							I could be somewhat specialized for international purchasing and be trusted by my colleagus and bosses.</p>
							<p>When I would soon resign the company, I had already summarized some routines and patterns and made documents for sharing know-hows.
							These documents may be helpful for new worker, even he or she is not confident for getting touch with foreign languages(English, Chinese, etc).</p>

						<div class= "pulldown_menu">
							<h3 class= "pulldown_purple">The events which let me start learning about IT</h3>
						</div>
						<div class= "menu_inclution">
							<p>I looked for more ways to use my avility. Then I happened to find web-advertisement of free programming trial in programming school.
							I felt something fascinating and joined. After the participation, I found programming seems to be good choice for me and decided to resign my job.
							</p>
							<p>During 5.5 years of my working, I found there are much more web-services and infrastructures to learn programming.
							I also found there are more supportive services for people with developmental disorder.
							I finally tried several free demonstrations of online-programming learning services. Then I convinced to be in IT industry.
							When I decleared my resign to company, it was April, 2018. I needed to quit for enough time of focusing on time and enviroment to study.
							<p>I might be suspected that I actually want to focus on the job which uses multiple languages.
							However, I think <b>focusing on IT can provide more contribution rather than focusing on languages.</b></p>
						</div>

					<li class= "job_introduction">
						<div class= "pulldown_menu">
							<h3 class= "pulldown_purple">How did I learn programming after resigning last job?</h3>
						</div>
						<div class= "menu_inclution">
							<p>I had visited certain self-learning-cafe almost every day (Mon-Fri), from 10 o`clock to 17 o`clock
							and learned programming mainly via "Codecamp" and "Progate". (*I could stay in cafe between 10-17 o`clock because of cafe`s plan)
							</p>
							<p>For example, I thought how codes work by writing what predecessor made, and made a sample of homepage by mainly using HTML and CSS.
							</p>
							<p>Since August, I started going to "Frontier Link" which is specialized for IT learning 
							for the people with developmental disorder aor mental disorder.
							</p>
							<p>Recently there are more learning circles also in the central town of Osaka. I join them about 2-3 times per month.</p>

						<div class= "pulldown_menu">
							<h3 class= "pulldown_purple">For further working</h3>
						</div>
						<div class= "menu_inclution">
							<p>I have learned HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript&jQuery, PHP&MySQL, Ruby by now.</p>
							<p>I am especially interested in Front-end skills such as<b>HTML, CSS, jQuery</b>.
							I also would like to deepen not only those 3, but also new skills such as Bootstrap, other JavaScript libraries, some backend languages such as PHP.

		<section id= "wrapper_syndrome" class= "wrappers">
			<h2 id= "intro_jump_no2">Traits: Strengths and weaknesses</h2>
				<ul>
					<li class= "job_introduction">
						<div class= "pulldown_menu">
							<h3 class= "pulldown_blue">Strength 1: High capability of long term memorization</h3>
						</div>
						<div class= "menu_inclution">
							<p>When I tried to remember certain things repeatedly and success to remember at the end, <b>I tend to have those memories for long term</b>.
							</p>
							<p>I often remember how we solved the task in the past after months or years, and <b>this tendency surprised my colleagues and bosses several times</b>.
							</p>
							<p>Furthermore, <b>I am <u>not</u> fixated with what I remembered first time</b>.
							I usually try to accept improvements or opinions for better results.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li class= "job_introduction">
						<div class= "pulldown_menu">
							<h3 class= "pulldown_blue">Strength 2: Good at making routines or patterns</h3>
						</div>
						<div class= "menu_inclution">
							<p>I think <b>I can smoothly repeat the job as soon as I got some routines</b>. This way is also important to <b>decrease mistakes</b>.
							</p>
							<p>In my last job, I wrote "routines" in PowerPoint, Word, or Excel. These documents were used as manuals in my division.
							They are very useful not only for avoiding repeated mistakes, but also for sharing know-hows and succeeding my skills.
							</p>
							<p>However, if these manuals are too intricated, these could be the triggers to cause another mistake.
							So <b>I also focused on omitting superfluous informations</b>, but maitaining core information.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li class= "job_introduction">
						<div class= "pulldown_menu">
							<h3 class= "pulldown_blue">Strength 3: Good at recognizing colors or shapes</h3>
						</div>
						<div class= "menu_inclution">
							<p>I heard that Asperger Syndrome has <b>strength to recognize colors and shapes</b>. 
							So I used colors as proper as possible when I make some documents and notes for division.</p>
							<p>In last job, <b>I had been praised that my documents were colorful and easy to understand</b> and I am thankful for such appreciations.
							Especially when I succeed my jobs to others, I did not have to tell succsessors so precisely thanks for these documents and manuals.
							Furthermore, they might be helpful for successors to understand correctly about what I did.</p>
							<p>I also use this tendency when I personally study. I leave the notes with using some colorful pens.
							This way of learning helps me to acquire the knowledge faster and more precise.
							</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					</ul>

					<ul>
					<li class= "job_introduction">
						<div class= "pulldown_menu">
							<h3 class= "pulldown_red">Weaknesses 1: Short term memorization and flexible responses</h3>
						</div>
						<div class= "menu_inclution">
							<p><b>When I got various informations within minutes, I seem to focus on limited information of them no matter how hard I work hard</b>.</p>
							<p>Because of such tendency, <b>I may need more time to understand things than oters, or make more mistakes because I might overlook something</b>.</p>
							<p>Sometimes I can realize what I have overlooked. In such situations, I may ask question(s) to avoid further mistakes.
							However, these questions could be a little bit too "intricated".
							I dare to beg that please do not tease, laugh at my questions. 
							And please do not misunderstand that I intend to humiliate others.</p>
							<p><b>I am seriously afraid that I might overlook "tiny but important" tips and cause severe troubles</b> because of this trait.</p>
							<p>Especially <b>when I understand how to proceed jobs, I try to take the note and summary</b>. This is inevitable to avoid asking questions repeatedly and undermine the efficiency of the team.</p>
							<p>I hope I can constantly make good results thanks for such understandings.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li class= "job_introduction">
						<div class= "pulldown_menu">
							<h3 class= "pulldown_red">Weaknesses 2: Vulnerability against aggressive/lambasting words, even they are jokes or ironies</h3>
						</div>
						<div class= "menu_inclution">
							<p><b>Even they are "just" jokes or ironies, I am mostly so vulnerable against the words such as "Fool", "Idiot", etc</b>.
							And I also would like to avoid doing something inappropriate, but I tend to lose the motivation to improve myself by being lambasted massively.
							</p>
							<p>Furthermore, Only I have been sometimes aimed by teasings, bullyings, or humiliations, maybe because I look "weird" "weak" "easy to puke something stressful" for those people.
							even when I tried to do my best.</p>
							<p>Fortunately, there are more suporters than past, <b>however, it is still risky for me to be exposed to such maltreatments</b>.
							<b>My memorization "works" and cannot forget those terrible events</b>, then I will finally not be able to endure myself.
							I am really afraid that those traumas may explode and give enormous nuisance to innocent others.</p>
							<p>I feel impossibility to cope with such intrusive behaviors only by myself. By now, I could fortunately avoid such dangers through the helps of bosses or supporters.
							<p>So I wish I can make supportive networks as much as possible, and use it when I am exposed to such threat and losing the working efficiency.</p>
							<p><b>If there are proper interventions and cooperations in such tragic cases, I can survive much easier and keep working efficiently</b>.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li class= "job_introduction">
						<div class= "pulldown_menu">
							<h3 class= "pulldown_red">Weaknesses 3: Oversensitivities</h3>
						</div>
						<div class= "menu_inclution">
							<p>I think <b>I could be affected by the oversensitivities of seeing, smelling, and hearing</b>. Here is my summary which includes my counter-measures.</p>
							<ul>
								<li class= "oversensitivity">Seeing: I am not tough against too intense lights.
								->Setting PC screenns darker, Activating Blue light cutting apprications, etc</li>
								<li class= "oversensitivity">Smelling: Easily distracted by strong smells of perfume, tabacco, etc.
								->I may be able to wear masks against such stimuli. However, sometimes those stressors penetrate mask.
								If I am in such toughness, I might beg changing the seat.
								(Cf. When I belonged to ITOKI, there was a woman who has really strong inscence of perfume almost everytime. The manager knew about this circumstance, and kindly set my seat apart from her when we chaged the layout of the office.
								</li>
								<li class= "oversensitivity">Hearing: Agressive, or destructive sounds, or unnecessarily banging sounds, too loud accusations may reduce my concentration so massively.
								(*If there is proper reason to blame against him/her, I could be affected less)
								->I try to shut out the stresses by using earplugs or listening to walkman.
								Of course, people may talk to me everytime, while I am shutting out such stressors.
								</li>
